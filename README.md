# jres R package
Import, pre-process and visualise 2D Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) data. J-resolved (jres) Magnetic Resonance Spectra. 

# functionality 
In the field of small molecule analysis (metabolomics/metabonomics) the annotation of 1D MRS features can be tricky in situations where there is a high degree of peak overlap. The visualiser is designed to to improve data interpretation / metaoblite annoation by combining a J-resolved spectrum (a fast 2D experiment that is standardly applied in high-throughput settings) with the respective 1D spectrum acquired from the same sample.

# installation
```R
#install.packages('devtools')
